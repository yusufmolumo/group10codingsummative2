This is how the application is used for question one

After creating the four files which are main.sh- the script file containing the code to Create the student record, Save each student record in a file under the name “students-list_0923.txt”, View all students saved in the file and list them on the terminal, Delete the student in the file (By using the student ID), Update the student record in the list (By using the student ID) and Exit the application. To run the main.sh script file. Use this command ./main.sh and follow the steps showed on how to use the application.

The second one which is the students-list_0923.txt- This is where all the information gotten from the main.sh and all the information a user provided when using the application is stored. The information to be stored is the (student email, age, and student ID)

The third one is a script file named select-emails.sh that get's all the student emails from the students-list_0923.txt file. To run the script file, use this command in  your command line ./select-emails.sh

The fourth and last one is the student-emails.txt. A text file that saves all the emails gotten after you run the select-emails.sh script file. So all the emails that's gotten after you run the select-emails.sh script file would be saved in student-emails.txt

So you should have all the four files required for question 1 and how to run the scripts
